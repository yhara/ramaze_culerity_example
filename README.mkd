==============================

Ramaze is a web application framework for Ruby (you know),
Celerity is a JRuby library for testing Ruby apps with 
HtmlUnit $(Q#|(B a headless Java browser with JavaScript support. 

If your Ramaze app works with JRuby, you don't need Culerity.
http://github.com/alvinschur/celerity-examples will help you.

But if not (eg. your app uses some C libraries not compatible
to JRuby), try [culerity](http://github.com/langalex/culerity).
