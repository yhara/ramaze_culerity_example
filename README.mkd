Example of Ramaze and Culerity
==============================

Ramaze is a web application framework for Ruby (you know),
Celerity is a JRuby library for testing Ruby apps with 
HtmlUnit $(Q#|(B a headless Java browser with JavaScript support. 

If your Ramaze app works with JRuby, you don't need Culerity.
